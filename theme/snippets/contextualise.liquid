    Adds a method for liquid templates to write context to the window for
    consumption by JS after page load. Contextualise has to go before all site
    scripts as they are deferred and this needs to be present before the page
    has finished parsing. THIS MUST NOT BE USED FOR SENSITIVE DATA!

    @param      {<type>}  scope   The scope of the context i.e. the id, key or location.
    @param      {<type>}  data    The data.
    @return     {<type>}  The data stored in the scope's location will always be
                        returned. In the case where a data object has been
                        provided then the return value can be used to verify
                        success   

    Please note: Contextualise cannot be deferred as the Window Method is required before the DOMContentLoaded event fires
